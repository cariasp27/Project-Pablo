# Project Pablo
After nursing a mallet finger injury of which I am still recovering from, I am finally engaging my love of coding and creation again. One of my favorite things about Web Development is the power of creation at my fingertips. From a simple vision in my head to a fully responsive web application I love the process of building. This is my current lovechild and will soon be my main Portfolio and base of Job Seeking Operations. Here is how the site will break down...

# Homepage
From the homepage you will see, front and center, a feed of my most recent posts. These may anything from random ideas to links to cool science. Under my headshot you will find a Linked In button (I am currently researching GSAP animations which I have used in vanilla HTML but not React) that will (at some point) when clicked, take you to my Linked In page. Next to that is an image some of you may be extremlly familiar with and some may haven't a clue as to where it is from. It is an image of a Minecraft bucket that (at some point) when clicked, will expand(GSAP Animation) to replace the blog feed and will display my 2020 bucket list. These are activities I am interested in throughout this year such as the Pablo Picasso exhibit at the Cleveland Museam of Art, and the Mysteries of the Maya at the Cincinati Museuem. Lastly, on the righthand side you can find the corresponding buttons to my various passion pages. These consist of art, music, science, and travel. Each page will be a different showcase consisting of photo roulette's, links to articles and videos, as well some of my favorite artists and short bios for them.

# Art (Under Construction)
This page will show off my personal art collection, art I have photographed, and artists who's work either I enjoyed or influenced me.
I imagine photo roulettes to display the photos if possible although using an embedded Facebook albulm might be a much smarter endavour.

# Music (Under Construction)
This page will host some of my largest playlists covering a vast array of genres, tempos, moods, and rhythms. I plan to have a large Spotify logo button similar to the Linked In one from Font Awesome. I imagine a photo stack style display of photos from the various concerts I have had the pleasure of experiencing.

# Science (Under Construction)
I LOVE SCIENCE. Ever since a kid I have had a neverending curiosity for how things work in the world around me. My mother, a scientist, is my hero and has had a profound impact on my love of science. I am a visual person and I watch a lot of science videos on YouTube and have developed a couple of playlists as well as know of other science so called "Deep Dives" that I plan to showcase here along with links to YouTube channels for those who want to learn more. I am planning to write a simple algorithm that will randomly pick a video from my YouTube science playlist and post it as the "Science Video of The Day".\

# Travel (Under Construction)
Being the son of a Guatemalan immigrant my mom clearly loved to travel. This was instilled in both me and my sister, my sister more so as she spent years abroad through both her high school and college.
